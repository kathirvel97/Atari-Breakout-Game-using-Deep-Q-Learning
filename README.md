# Atari Breakout Game using Deep Q-Learning

As part of my course in Reinforcement learning, I was able to complete this project. I was able to develop a Deep Q-Learning Network (DQN) to play the Atari Breakout game. The objective is to achieve an average reward exceeding 40 points over 100 episodes, each containing 5 lives. The implementation utilizes PyTorch, OpenAIâ€™s Gymnasium, and the Atari wrapper, incorporating improvements such as the dueling architecture and prioritized experience replay.
